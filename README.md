Sport analysis program GoldenCheetah enables you to add your own scripts in
certain languages. Of the options, most of mine will be in Python. In this
repository I keep track of them since the GC interface is on the clunky side.

## Keeping Things Clean

- Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting. Just run the
  default, no need to think about anything.
- Try out [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting. Will catch
  unused imports, variables, tell you when you should do something another way.
